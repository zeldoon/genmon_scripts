# genmon_scripts
Some genmon scripts for xfce4 that I find useful on kali

# Need to do
So you will need to pick some icons for the scripts as I have not put in default icon locations

# Some info about genmon scripts
I would of loved to have had all these basic scripts put into one program but genmon does not like to pump out a lot of information so they have been seperated. They are put into function format if you would like to use them elsewhere
