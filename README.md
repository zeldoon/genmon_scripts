# genmon_scripts
Some genmon scripts for xfce4 that I find useful on kali

# Need to do
So you will need to pick some icons for the scripts as I have not put in default icon locations

# Some info about genmon scripts
I would of loved to have had all these basic scripts put into one program but genmon does not like to pump out a lot of information so they have been seperated. They are put into function format if you would like to use them elsewhere

# What the scripts do
genmon-show-down.sh will show you which interfaces are down so you can bring them up if need be
	
genmon-show-up.sh will show you all interfaces that are up and give you the local ip for them
	
genmon-vpn-show-ip.sh will show you your WAN ip and will display different icons depending on the fact if your vpn is active

# At some point...
At some point I would like to have click events to bring devices down, bring devices up, put devices in monitor mode ... only problem is there seem to be a lot of un-documented limitations to genmon scripts
